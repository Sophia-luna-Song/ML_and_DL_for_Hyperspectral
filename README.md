# ML_and_DL_for_Hyperspectral

This entry includes three deep learning algorithms for near-infrared hyperspectral image analysis: two deep learning algorithms based on transformers for processing hyperspectral images (OPC-Transformer, KIT-Tabtransformer), and one algorithm reproduced from other research (ACNNR).

This section contains the code for the deep learning model. The machine learning code used in this study can be found at the following link [https://github.com/Sophia-luna-Song/HSI_Automatic]
